# Gemini CLI Harness Guide

## Purpose

Gemini CLI can load `GEMINI.md` context files and can be configured to read `AGENTS.md` directly.

## Source Of Truth

- Canonical: `AGENTS.md`
- Gemini adapter: `GEMINI.md`
- Rules: `docs/agent-rules/`
- Workflows: `docs/skills/`

## What Belongs In `.gemini/`

- Gemini CLI settings
- Gemini subagents
- Gemini custom commands
- Optional Gemini policy/hook configuration

## Native Agents

Gemini CLI may use its native subagents on the current Gemini branch. Follow the shared ownership rules in `docs/harness/multi-agent-workflow.md`. Worktree isolation remains an optional Gemini capability, not the default template workflow.

## What Must Stay Neutral

- Business rules
- Architecture rules
- Test policy
- Data model rules
- Security policy
